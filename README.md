# causica-examples
This repo walks you through multiple examples on using [Causica](https://github.com/microsoft/causica) for causal discovery and inference, a.k.a. end-to-end inference through DECI model [1]. The intention of this repo is providing a smoother user-experience compared to the [original notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/causica/tree/main/examples/DECI) if your original data is in pandas dataframe format. The [demo notebook](https://github.com/mry-tvk/causica-examples/blob/main/DECI%20demo%20-%20from_pandas%20.ipynb) also provides instruction for using causica in Azure ML and Databricks. The csuite dataset is generated by [original causica simulator](https://github.com/microsoft/causica/blob/main/causica/data_generation/csuite/simulate.py), and for easier use it is also compressed and included in [this repo](https://github.com/mry-tvk/causica-examples/blob/main/demo-data.zip).

We continue to improve this repository with more examples of the usage, functionality, and a more explanatory blogpost. Stay tuned!
